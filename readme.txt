With an auto updating live blog you get all the benefits of WordPress live blogging combined with an enhanced user experience keeping your readers on your website for longer.

== Installation ==

Install and Activate the Required Advanced Custom Fields Plugin. Live Blog WP can’t function on it’s own, it needs Advanced Custom Fields to make the process of linking posts together easier. Install the Advanced Custom Fields plugin from your WordPress admin.

Add the Gutenberg Block to a Post Which Enables the Feed. You can use any new or existing post for your live blog, edit the post with the Gutenberg editor and add the Live Blog WP block. It’s under the Widgets section.

Create Some Posts for Your Live Blog Feed. Now we need to add some content that will be shown in the feed. The plugin adds a custom post type call Live Blog Posts, we need to add some posts under this post type.

Attach the Live Post to the Post with the Gutenberg Block. When we add live posts we need to tell the plugin which Gutenberg block it relates to. Set the post using the drop down and if required also set it as a key point. As you add more posts they will automatically show in the feed on the front end.

Customize the Plugin to better Suit Your Needs. You can change the text, colors and other settings for the plugin using the WordPress Customizer under Customize > Live Blog WP.
